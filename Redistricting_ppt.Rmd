## Intro: Redistricting vs. Gerrymandering

Redistricting:

-   Part of the constitution, designed to ensure fair representation
-   Based on results of decennial census
-   All states with more than 1 district redraw their maps
-   Traditionally done by state legislatures

Gerrymandering:

-   Almost as old as the constitution
-   Drawing districts in peculiar ways to gain political advantage
-   Party in power can entrench itself to maintain power

## Terminology

-   "Redistricting" - The redrawing of legislative district lines following the census in order to accommodate population shifts and keep districts as equal as possible.

-   Each state has its own institution for drawing new congressional districts after a census:

    -   Legislature

    -   Commission (Politican, Independent)

    -   Courts (Federal, State)

    -   Exceptions (single-district states, etc)

    -   Partisan redistricting - State legislatures have control and can arrange electoral districts in a way that benefits their party

    -   Non- partisan redistricting - Electoral districts are drawn by a third party where membership is reserved for political independents

## Background and Theory

-   Hayes and Mckee (2009; 2011) found strong effects in participation among black Americans

-   Best and Lem (2021) found that three of seven states analyzed favored a single party

-   Hypothesis: Nonpartisan redistricting methods should lead to higher turnout

Generally speaking, vote share should be close to seat share. If not, that's a serious anti-democratic issue

## Research questions

-   Do non-partisan redistricting methods lead to closer vote margins in Congressional elections?

-   Does the institution that draws the maps have a correlation with voter turnout?

## Data Sources

-   Congressional election data, 2000-2020

    -   via MIT Election Lab Level: Congressional District

-   Redistricting policies by state, 2000-2020

    -   via Loyola Law School
    -   CSV file that includes information about how each state's method of redrawing electoral district lines
    -   columns include: state, seats, legal default, last drawn by, and control

-   US Census turnout

    -   US Census Bureau: Voter registration and turnout, 1972-2020

## Data cleaning and merging

-   Election: Drop with states with only one district

-   Redistricting data: (Identifying states that redrew their district maps between censuses to create state-year-drawing institution observations)

-   Locating required tables nested within 'printer-friendly' excel sheet.

-   Merge on State-year pairs.

-   Graphs

-   Regression 1: Turnout (pres/midterm)

-   Regression 2: Margins

## Results - Turnout by time/institution
