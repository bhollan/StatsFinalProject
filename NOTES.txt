 load two datasets - elecction results, and redistricting

1.1  Redistricting data (ger) -- BRAD_17nov
 
 # drop States that only have 1 district have "n/a" for "institution"

 # Clean the drawn by column according to institution
 
 # In the gerry data, create election year column that assigns the state's redistricting with an individual.
 
 # Which state-elections have changed maps in the middle of a cycle? 
 
 # Create dummy variables for Institution/drawnby?
 
# See where/why they were different

2. Census data needed:
	
	Registered voters OR
	Voting-age population


BRIAN:
	Clean and Merge the Census data
	Find why NAs are coming from Institution column in ‘merged’ DF (DC)
	Write presentation draft
    Hypothesis: "redistricting method/policy has an affect on turnout"
	Email prof about "audience assumptions" re:gerrymandering


Data cleaning
Why are we breaking out by party at all?

KUMAR:
	Move everything from Google Drive into GitHub (anything under 100Mb is fine)


Future work:
	Turnout by party
	Turnout by party assuming “drawn_by” for in/out-party elections
