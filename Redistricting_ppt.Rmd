## Topic

-   Investigating the affects of states' redistricting stance on voter turnout.

## 

## Problem

-   "Redistricting" in the US - normal, decennial process through states redraw the boundaries of districts

-   redistricting processes can be manipulated through gerrymandering to suit their political parties best interest

-   Currently, many states are trying to combat this practice by transferring redistricting power from state legislatures to non-legislative institutions, or commissions

## Terminology

<<<<<<< HEAD
-   Following the decennial census, each state is required by federal law to redraw their districts.
=======
- "Redistricting" - Following the decennial census, states redraw their districts

- Each state has its own process for drawing new congressional districts after a census. Most statesâ€™ policies can fall into one of two groups: partisan or non-partisan.

- The majority of states rely on legislatures, and thus the party in control at the state level, to draw the new districts, with little oversight or judicial involvement. Other states have made laws that force the redistricting process to be done by an outside commission.

##Background and Theory

-   Hayes and Mckee (2009; 2011) used precinct level election data for five states from 1992 to 2006, finding that the negative effects on participation are highest among African Americans.

<<<<<<< HEAD
-   Best and Lem (2021) analyzed data from 3 states with independent commissions and 4 states with other types of commissions in the 2010 redistricting, finding that three of seven commissions produced redistricting results benefiting one party.

-   Non-partisan redistricting methods should lead to higher turnout.
=======
- Hayes and Mckee (2009; 2011) found strong effects in participation among black Americans

- Best and Lem (2021) found that three of seven states analyzed favored a single party

- Hypothesis: Nonpartisan redistricting methods should lead to higher turnout

Generally speaking, vote share should be close to seat share. If not, that's a serious anti-democratic issue

## Research questions

-   

    1.  Do non-partisan redistricting methods lead to closer vote margins in Congressional elections?

-   

    2.  Does the institution that draws the maps have a correlation with voter turnout?

## Data Sources

-   **1. Congressional election data, 2000-2020** MIT Election Lab Level: Congressional District

-   **2. Redistricting policies by state, 2000-2020**

-   via Loyola Law School

-   CSV file that includes information about how each state's method of redrawing electoral district lines

-   columns include: state, seats, legal default, last drawn by, and control

-   **3. US Census turnout** US Census Bureau: Voter registration and turnout, 1972-2020

## Data cleaning and merging

-   Election: Drop with states with only one district

-   Redistricting data: (Identifying states that redrew their district maps between censuses to create state-year-drawing institution observations)

-   Locating required tables nested within 'printer-friendly' excel sheet.

-   Merge on State-year pairs.

## Methods

-   Graphs

-   Regression 1: Turnout (pres/midterm)

-   Regression 2: Margins

## Results - Turnout by time/institution

## Results

-   Regression
