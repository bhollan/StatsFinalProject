## Problem

- Investigating the affects of states' redistricting stance on voter turnout.

 - "Redistricting" in the US - normal, decennial process through states redraw the boundaries of  districts

 - Concerns about fairness (In a perfect world, the lines would be drawn in the fairest way possible. But even that is hard to measure and execute, depending on your version of "fair")

 - How the lines are drawn might influence election outcomes.(There is very little guidance and even fewer rules about what the line-drawing process is supposed to be, and the lines can easily be drawn to favor your party over the other.)
 
- Recent increase in partisan polarization, role of redistricting (The "guardrail" of democratic behavior usually meant moderate gains losses during redistricting, knowing your party might not be in power in 10 years. But recently, tactics have grown fiercely partisan in many cases).

## Problem

- Gerrymandering 

- Decennial census to apportion seats, redraw district lines

- Usually state legislatures. Fairness and using redistricting for political influence

- Draw district maps in a way to win disproportionately.

- Now states are moving towrds indepndent commissions and courts.

- If district boundaries have made a district a sure seat for Dems, e.g.

## Terminology

- "Redistricting" - Following the decennial census, states redraw their districts

- Each state has its own process for drawing new congressional districts after a census. Most statesâ€™ policies can fall into one of two groups: partisan or non-partisan.

- The majority of states rely on legislatures, and thus the party in control at the state level, to draw the new districts, with little oversight or judicial involvement. Other states have made laws that force the redistricting process to be done by an outside commission.



 - Legislature
 - Commission
 - Courts
 - Exceptions (single-district states, etc)



##Background and Theory


- Hayes and Mckee (2009; 2011) found strong effects in participation among black Americans

- Best and Lem (2021) found that three of seven states analyzed favored a single party

- Hypothesis: Nonpartisan redistricting methods should lead to higher turnout

Generally speaking, vote share should be close to seat share. If not, that's a serious anti-democratic issue



## Research questions


- 1. Do non-partisan redistricting methods lead to closer vote margins in Congressional elections?

- 2. Does the institution that draws the maps have a correlation with voter turnout?






## Data Sources

- **1. Congressional election data, 2000-2020**
MIT Election Lab
Level: Congressional District

- **2. Redistricting policies by state, 2000-2020**
Loyola Law School


- **3. US Census turnout**

## Data cleaning and merging

- Election: Drop with states with only one district

- Redistricting data: (Identifying states that redrew their district maps between censuses to create state-year-drawing institution observations)


- Locating required tables nested within 'printer-friendly' excel sheet.


-  Merge on State-year pairs.



## Methods

- Graphs

- Regression 1: Turnout (pres/midterm)

- Regression 2: Margins


## Results - Turnout by time/institution

- Regression
