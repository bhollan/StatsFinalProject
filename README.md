PPOL 560 Final Project for Group 1


Data Sources:
 - US Census (census.gov)
   + https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/voting-and-registration/p20-585.html
   + https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/voting-and-registration/voting-historical-time-series.html
 - Loyola Law school (redistricting.lls.edu/)
   + https://redistricting.lls.edu/national-overview/?colorby=Institution&level=Congress&cycle=2020
 - MIT Election Lab (electionlab.mit.edu/)
   + https://electionlab.mit.edu/data



Run the `Analysis.Rmd` file and it will output a fresh instance of the (pre-existing) `votes_redistricting.csv` file. That process pulls our downloaded sources from the `./source_data` folder. The `Redistricting.Rmd` file compiles our slides into HTML and pulls mostly from pre-existing files in the `/images` folder.
